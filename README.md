SpaceEco - Space Station Waste Management System 🚀

SpaceEco is a specialized web application designed for astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS) to manage and document daily waste production and recycling processes. In the orbital environment, every gram of waste is critical, and efficient management is vital for station safety and logistics.

📖 Project Overview
The system enables crew members to track various types of waste—such as plastics, food scraps, and faulty equipment—to maintain a clean station and prevent the accumulation of hazardous materials. It facilitates precise reporting to Earth to streamline disposal during the next cargo ship mission.

✨ Key Features

- Real-Time Dashboard: Visual monitoring of recycling bin capacities (water, plastic, metal, etc.) using dynamic color-coded indicators.
Waste Reporting System: A digital form to log items by name, category, and weight, including data validation for orbital safety.
- Safety & Compliance: Dedicated safety cards for hazardous items (e.g., lithium batteries) featuring instructional videos for proper disposal.
- Activity Logs: A comprehensive log of reports synced with mission control on Earth, highlighting hazardous materials for immediate attention.


🛠 Technical Stack
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript.
UI Framework: Bootstrap (utilized for progress bars, accordions, and responsive design).
Backend: PHP for server-side logic and data processing.
Database: Integrated database for persistent storage of waste logs and station status.


🖥 System Modules

Station Status: Graphical overview of container levels.
Waste Catalog: Categorized recycling guidelines and procedures.
Log Waste Form: Validated data entry for weight and material type.
Safety Card: Specialized handling instructions for dangerous goods.
My Log: Personal shift activity history and reporting status.
